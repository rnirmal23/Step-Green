## 🐻‍❄️ Installation and First Launch

1. Download the latest prebuilt binary (.apk file) from android studio.
2. Run the downloaded file and temporarily allow instalation from unknown sources if prompted (turn it back off after installation).
3. Click "Install" and wait for the app to install.
4. On some devices you may encounter a Play Protect warning, but don't worry - the app is safe to use, and open-sourced. I'm just an unverified developer.
5. You are now good to go 🚀.
